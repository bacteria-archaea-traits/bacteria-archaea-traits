Mason MM (1935) "A comparison of the maximual growth rates of various bacteria under optimal conditions"

Data was obtained by manually extracting values from table 1 in the paper.

Species names have been manually "translated" to modern names using ncbi taxonomy browser. In cases where tax browser did not return a positive match, litterature search was conducted to find name synonyms. 

New names and comments are provided in the columns with the prefix "mw_".
