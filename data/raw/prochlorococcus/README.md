# Pochlorococcus notes

This data was obtained directly from Dr Lisa Moore (MQ). 

The data sometimes had multiple data points for doubling time and cell size per strain. Several decisions were made to make these data comparable with Silva and Bergeys:

- *Doubling time*: growth rate per day data were converted to doubling time in hours. Where there are two measurements, the mean was used. Standard deviations have been ignored. 
- *Cell diameter*: a range for cell diameter was created from the modal and mean cell size values.
- *Cell length*: was left as is. Cell will be considered spherical where length data are missing.
